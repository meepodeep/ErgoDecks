Today, I designed the PCB for the ErgoDecks, I also researched what components to use. I decided on the nice!nano for the MCU based on a recommendation/inspiration from another Hack Clubber!

# 5/28/25 Got rejected and made some changes!

Today I realized I needed to change up my bom a bit. I changed the mcu to a generic one and I also made some updates to the case.

**Total time spent: 1h**

# 6/23/25  So close but so far away.

Today I got all of my parts and I started assembling the keyboards. I soldered on all of the switches, diodes, and the MCU, but what I didn't realize is I soldered the MCU one set of pins offset up. And when I desoldered it from the pins, neither of them connected to my pc anymore.

**Total time spent: 11h**

# 6/25/25 a ITWORKS! but i suck at typing on it.....

Today I finally got it working! I wrote my own config for zmk and replaced the dead mcus! i still suck at typing thoooo i think thats just skill issue not keyboard issue.....
